# Streamlit Classification application for Iris dataset

In this project, an easy to use streamlit application is developed for classification problem. The application has a specific page for project description, viewing raw dataset, exploratory data analysis, model development and model predictions. Therefore, this is an end to end example including all steps for multi-class classification performed on iris dataset. 

# Steps for reproducing on your machine
1. Create a virtual enviroment (Optional but would highly recommend as this comes under best practices)
2. Install Requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application: streamlit run flower_app.py
